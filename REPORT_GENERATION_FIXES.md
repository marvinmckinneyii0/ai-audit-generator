## How to Use

### 1. **Setting Up API Keys**
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# - REACT_APP_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY: Get from https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
# - REACT_APP_APITEMPLATE_API_KEY: Get from https://apitemplate.io/
# - REACT_APP_APITEMPLATE_TEMPLATE_ID: Your template ID from APITemplate.io
```

### 2. **Running the Application**
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

### 3. **Generating Reports**

#### Without API Keys:
- The application will work with mock data for Perplexity searches
- PDF generation will fallback to Markdown download
- All core functionality remains available

#### With API Keys:
- Perplexity API enables advanced research for Tier 3 analysis
- APITemplate.io enables professional PDF generation
- Full feature set is available

### 4. **Report Formats**
The application now supports two report formats:
1. **PDF Report** (requires APITemplate.io)
   - Professional formatting
   - Ready for client presentation
   - Includes all visual elements

2. **Markdown Report** (always available)
   - Plain text format
   - Easy to edit and customize
   - Can be converted to other formats
   - Includes all analysis data

## Testing the Application

1. **Start with Tier 1** (Solopreneur Quick Wins) for fastest testing
2. **Fill in basic client data**:
   - Company name
   - Industry
   - Number of employees
   - Budget range
   - Add at least 2-3 pain points

3. **Skip optional sections** for quick testing:
   - Voice of Customer files are optional
   - You can proceed without uploading files

4. **Run MCDA Analysis** in the Solutions section

5. **Generate Report**:
   - Try "Download Markdown" first (always works)
   - Try "Download PDF" if you have API keys configured

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Perplexity API key not configured"
- **Solution**: Add your Perplexity API key to the `.env` file
- **Note**: The app will still work with mock data

### Issue: PDF generation fails
- **Solution**: Check APITemplate.io API key and template ID in `.env`
- **Fallback**: Use the Markdown download option

### Issue: MCDA analysis not running
- **Solution**: Ensure you've filled in required client discovery fields
- **Required**: Company name, industry, employees, budget, and at least one pain point

### Issue: Report has no data
- **Solution**: Complete the MCDA analysis before generating reports
- **Check**: Ensure analysis results show in the Solutions section

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Robustness**: Application now handles missing API keys gracefully
2. **Flexibility**: Supports both PDF and Markdown report formats
3. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and fallback mechanisms
4. **Code Quality**: Fixed all structural issues and duplicate code
